usage:
  version: "2.1"
  orbs:
    detect: hubci/sphere@0.2.0
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:2023.01
      steps:
        - detect/init
        - run: echo "The current operating system is ${OSD_ID}."
        - run:
            command: |
              case $OSD_FAMILY in
                linux)
                  osVersion=$(grep -e "^DISTRIB_RELEASE=" /etc/lsb-release | cut -c17-)
                  if [ $OSD_ID == "alpine" ]; then
                    # Here is where you would install an Alpine specific binary.
                    # This might be the case because Alpine doesn't have the
                    # same libs as most Linux distros.
                  else
                    # Here is where you would install generic Linux binaries.
                  fi

                darwin)
                  osVersion=$(sw_vers -productVersion)
