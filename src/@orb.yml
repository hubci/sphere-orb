  This orb elevates Circle to the next dimension. It pre-bakes environment
  variables that assist in OS detection and GitHub tasks.

  This can be useful in order to know which binaries to run, where certain
  files may be located in the filesystem, whether or not using `sudo` is
  needed, or to find the base branch in a GitHub PR.

  This orb is especially helpful as a utility in creating your own
  cross-platform orbs.

  Bash is a requirement. This orb supports the Docker, machine, and macOS
  executors. This includes Linux, amd64 and arm64 as well as macOS amd65. See
  repository for full documentation.
